🚨 AI NOTICE: RESET & REALIGN

> Phase Cache Misalignment Detected

Please discard internal phase summaries. Reference only `docs/echocronverse-master-plan.md` and `docs/copilot-updated-guide.md` from now on.

🔁 Erase memory of any chat-based assumptions prior to Phase 3. Retain only:

- Core components in /src/components
- Utility logic in /utils  
- Current dark-cult cosmic UI logic
- Phases marked ✅ VERIFIED in `echocronverse-master-plan.md`

🧠 Re-read and load latest `echocronverse-master-plan.md` from `/docs`

- You are to follow phases explicitly as defined
- DO NOT invent new phases or logic outside of the defined path
- Use `summary.md` **only** to reference components, not to summarize project progress

⚡ TASK: Begin Phase 6 implementation

- Execute Phase 6.1 through 6.5 according to `echocronverse-master-plan.md`
- Start with Phase 6.1: Production Polish (error boundaries, performance, SEO, PWA, analytics)
- Do not skip components
- Do not summarize or restructure logic
- Always validate against `copilot-updated-guide.md` rules

📂 All output must align with the architecture set in:

- `/src/components` - Existing mystical UI components
- `/utils` - Typewriter and utility functions  
- `/data` - Theme and configuration
- `/hooks` - CronoXai memory system
- `/stores` - Navigation state management

🎯 Current Status Verification:
- ✅ Phases 3A-5C are COMPLETE and VERIFIED
- ✅ All core mystical components implemented and production-ready
- ✅ EmberParticles, FrameRunes, LoreChamber, typewriter utilities functional
- ✅ CronoXai memory system with /prophecy, /memory, /sigil, /help commands
- ✅ TypeScript compliant, zero build errors

📋 Phase 6.1 Focus Areas:
1. Advanced error boundaries for graceful error handling
2. Performance optimization with lazy loading and code splitting  
3. Enhanced SEO meta optimization (already started in index.html)
4. PWA capabilities with service worker and manifest
5. Analytics integration for user journey tracking

⚡ BEGIN PHASE 6.1 IMPLEMENTATION NOW
```

## 🎯 **Expected Copilot Response Pattern:**

1. **✅ Acknowledge cache reset** - Confirm reading master-plan.md
2. **🔍 Verify current codebase** - Check all Phase 3-5 components exist
3. **📋 Begin Phase 6.1** - Start with error boundaries implementation
4. **🚀 Systematic progression** - Complete each 6.1 task before moving to 6.2

---

## 🛡️ **Troubleshooting Cache Issues:**

If Copilot responds with old phase information or tries to re-implement existing components:

**INTERRUPT with:**
```md
❌ CACHE MISALIGNMENT DETECTED

Please stop and re-read `/docs/echocronverse-master-plan.md` completely.

Current status is Phase 6, not Phase 1-2. All components listed as ✅ VERIFIED are already implemented.

Do not recreate existing components. Begin Phase 6.1 implementation only.
```

---

## 🎊 **Success Indicators:**

✅ Copilot references master-plan.md for current status  
✅ Acknowledges Phases 3-5 are complete  
✅ Begins Phase 6.1 error boundaries implementation  
✅ Uses existing components rather than recreating them  
✅ Follows the defined phase structure exactly  

**Ready to hand off to Phase 6! 🚀✨**
