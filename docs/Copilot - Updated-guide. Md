## ✅ Copilot Must Follow These Rules

- ☑️ **Always read `master-plan.md` and this file before generating anything.**
- ⛔ **Never assume or generate new phases without explicit approval.**
- ☑️ **Use `summary.md` only for UI and style reference, not planning.**
- ⛔ **Do NOT summarize full chat history into phases or assumptions.**
- ☑️ **Ask before changing logic in `/components`, `/utils`, or `/features`.**
- ⛔ **Do NOT reintroduce deprecated components from pre-Phase 3 builds.**

## 🔧 File Placement
- `docs/master-plan.md` → primary roadmap
- `docs/copilot-guide.md` → this sync layer
- `docs/summary.md` → visual/animation/UI focus only
