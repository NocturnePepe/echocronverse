## 🧬 STRUCTURE FOR COPILOT (AND FUTURE DEV ONBOARDING)

### 📋 Production Guidelines
See `AI.md` for comprehensive development standards, phase tracking, and technical requirements established in Phase 3B.

### � Copilot Sync Guidelines

### ✅ **Copilot Development Rules** (from Updated Guide)
- ☑️ **Always read master-plan.md and copilot guide before generating anything**
- ⛔ **Never assume or generate new phases without explicit approval**
- ☑️ **Use summary.md only for UI and style reference, not planning**
- ⛔ **Do NOT summarize full chat history into phases or assumptions**
- ☑️ **Ask before changing logic in /components, /utils, or /features**
- ⛔ **Do NOT reintroduce deprecated components from pre-Phase 3 builds**
