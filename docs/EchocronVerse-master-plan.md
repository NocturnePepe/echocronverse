# 📜 ECHOCRONVERSE MASTER PLAN

> **"Where Time Echoes, Minds Merge, and Mystical Code Breathes."**  
> From NocturnePepe to Echocronverse — the vision continues.

## � AI CACHE CONTROL SYSTEM

### 📋 **CACHE RESET PROTOCOL FOR AI AGENTS**
> **CRITICAL**: All AI agents (Copilot, GPT, Claude, etc.) must read this section first

#### ⚡ **Phase Alignment Rules:**
- ☑️ **Always sync with echocronverse-master-plan.md before continuing development**
- ☑️ **When reaching new phases (6+), erase cache history older than 3 phases while keeping memory of:**
  - Component definitions in `/src/components`
  - Completed logic layers in `/utils`
  - Unused/paused features for future reference
- ⛔ **DO NOT backtrack to old styling or deprecated systems unless explicitly requested**
- ☑️ **Use echocronverse-master-plan.md to verify current scope, not chat history**
- 🧠 **Reference `/docs/copilot-updated-guide.md` for development rules and standards**

#### 🔄 **Cache Misalignment Detection:**
If you detect inconsistencies between chat history and this master plan:
1. **DISCARD** chat-based assumptions
2. **RELOAD** from `/docs/echocronverse-master-plan.md`
3. **VERIFY** component status in actual codebase
4. **PROCEED** according to defined phases only
