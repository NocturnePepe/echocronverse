# 🧠 Copilot Guidance & Phase Lock Directive

## ⚠️ SYSTEM NOTICE – Cache Loop / Phantom Memory Glitch

We've identified recurring issues with Copilot's cache behavior:
- Repeating already completed phases (e.g. Phase 5C)
- Over-summarizing chat history and skipping critical context
- Injecting new phase logic beyond the officially approved master plan

This **glitch appears after prolonged use or deep message trees**, where Copilot attempts to "fill in" gaps instead of referencing the canonical roadmap.

## 🧹 Phase Cache Purge Policy

To reduce rogue behavior and keep advancement intentional:

1. **Purge non-critical cache** after every *three full phases*.  
2. **Retain**:
   - All completed component and feature folder logic
   - Utility functions, helpers, constants
   - Structural logic used in `/src`, `/components`, `/hooks`, `/stores`
3. **Important memory retention includes**:
   - Phase progress markers (see `docs/master-plan.md`)
   - Roadmap decisions from `/docs`
   - Core design themes and reusable logic patterns

## 📜 Master Plan Enforcement

- **PRIMARY REFERENCE**: `/docs/EchocronVerse-master-plan.md` for current roadmap
- **CURRENT STATUS**: **Phase 3B Complete** ✅ (Production Architecture)
- **NEXT PHASE**: **Phase 3C: Memory Lock & Lore Reveal** (TO BE IMPLEMENTED)

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: Until Phase 3C is fully implemented with actual components, Copilot **must not** jump to Phase 4 or beyond.

> ✨ **Verification Rule**: Component folders must reflect each completed phase. Missing components = incomplete phase.

## 📁 DOCS FIRST Policy

Copilot is instructed to prioritize:
- `/docs/EchocronVerse-master-plan.md` - **PRIMARY ROADMAP**
- `/docs/SUMMARY.md` - Component documentation  
- `/docs/Copilot - Updated-guide.Md` - Phase sync rules
- `/AI.md` - Development standards
- And **NOT** infer based on repo structure or hallucinated cache

This ensures logical memory progression and prevents unintended overreach.

## 🚀 Final Directive

> **Instruction for Copilot:**  
> "Before progressing beyond Phase 3C, verify all required components exist in the codebase.  
> Use `/docs/EchocronVerse-master-plan.md` as the primary reference.  
> Log phase completion and commit updates before advancing to next phase.  
> **Never assume phases are complete based on documentation alone - verify actual implementation.**"
